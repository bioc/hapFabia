Description: A package to identify very short IBD segments in large
        sequencing data by FABIA biclustering. Two haplotypes are
        identical by descent (IBD) if they share a segment that both
        inherited from a common ancestor. Current IBD methods reliably
        detect long IBD segments because many minor alleles in the
        segment are concordant between the two haplotypes. However,
        many cohort studies contain unrelated individuals which share
        only short IBD segments. This package provides software to
        identify short IBD segments in sequencing data. Knowledge of
        short IBD segments are relevant for phasing of genotyping data,
        association studies, and for population genetics, where they
        shed light on the evolutionary history of humans. The package
        supports VCF formats, is based on sparse matrix operations, and
        provides visualization of haplotype clusters in different
        formats.
